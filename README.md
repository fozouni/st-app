Hi to all. This repo aims to implement a web application by using **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** which we've built from the following address 

**https://github.com/fozouni/absenteeism** 

Note that in this work we are just using the file "Absenteeism_new_data.csv" in the main branch of repo for prediction. If you want to upload your arbitrary csv file, follow the instruction in this Medium Article 

**[Python Streamlit: Uploading and Using Files](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/python-streamlit-uploading-and-using-files-cf797dc30be3)**

Happy Learning 😁😊!
